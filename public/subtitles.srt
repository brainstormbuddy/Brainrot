00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So you know about backpropagation, right? It's like the secret sauce that makes neural networks get jacked.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Picture this. Your AI is cruising along trying to figure stuff out, and when it trips up,

3

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
backpropagation is like that chill coach that strolls over and goes,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, let's tweak your technique a bit. It's not about getting it perfect on the first try.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's about those little adjustments. The AI takes a swing at a problem, and maybe it misses.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But then, bam, backpropagation steps in, runs the tape back, and it's like,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, let's shift your stance, adjust the angle, and go again.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And with each pass, your AI is getting sharper, learning from the slips,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
kind of like how a comedian hones a bit after a few rough sets.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's all about that sweet spot, training the brain of the machine to hit the punchline every time.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wild, right?
