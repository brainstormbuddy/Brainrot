1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, you know about backpropagation, right?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's like the secret sauce that makes neural networks get jacked.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Picture this.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Your AI is cruising along trying to figure stuff out,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and when it trips up, backpropagation is like that chill coach

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that strolls over and goes,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey, let's tweak your technique a bit.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's not about getting it perfect on the first try.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's about those little adjustments.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The AI takes a swing at a problem,

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and maybe it misses,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but then, BAM!

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Backpropagation steps in, runs the tape back,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and it's like,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, let's shift your stance, adjust the angle, and go again.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And with each pass, your AI is getting sharper,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
learning from the slips,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
kind of like how a comedian hones a bit after a few rough sets.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's all about that sweet spot,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
training the brain of the machine to hit the punchline every time.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wild, right?
